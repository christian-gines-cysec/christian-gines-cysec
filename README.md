### 👋 About Me

I spent 20+ years building and protecting real-world infrastructure — leading telecom deployments, securing backbone networks, and running operations for US clients — and I’m now focused on **cybersecurity, cloud security, and AI-driven defense systems**.

I combine:
- **Security operations & incident response**
- **Network & infrastructure security**
- **Revenue leadership / tech sales** for US & UK markets  

My goal: **turn complex networks and complex products into something secure, understandable, and easy to buy.**
