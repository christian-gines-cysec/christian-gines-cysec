# 🌐 **About Me**

Over two decades, I’ve built, led, and defended critical telecommunications infrastructure, directed high-performance teams, and delivered secure operations for national carriers and U.S. enterprise clients.  

Today, I merge that foundation with cybersecurity, threat-detection engineering, and advanced sales strategy — creating a hybrid skillset built for modern security-driven organizations.

I specialize in:

- Cyber defense & network forensics  
- AI-assisted reconnaissance (ARRIA)  
- Red-team methodologies & adaptive threat analysis  
- Enterprise-level negotiation & B2B sales strategy  
- Technical evangelism for cybersecurity & cloud products  
- High-intent closing using value-driven, assumptive frameworks
