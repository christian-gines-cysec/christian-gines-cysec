## 👋 About Me

I build, secure, and scale real-world systems.

For 20+ years, I’ve led high-stakes operations — from telecom infrastructure deployments to revenue leadership for U.S. clients — and today, I merge that experience with **cybersecurity**, **network defense**, and **AI-driven intelligence systems**.

I combine:

- **Security operations & incident response**  
- **Network & infrastructure defense**  
- **Red-team mindset with OPSEC discipline**  
- **Tech sales & revenue leadership for U.S. markets**  
- **AI automation for training, reconnaissance, and workforce acceleration**

My goal is simple:  
**Turn complex technologies into systems that are secure, understandable, and easy for organizations to adopt.**
