## 🌍 About Me

I build, secure, and scale real-world systems.

For 20+ years, I’ve led high-stakes operations — from telecom infrastructure deployments to revenue leadership for U.S. clients — and today, I merge that experience with **cybersecurity**, **network defense**, and **AI-driven intelligence systems**.

I specialize in:

- **Cyber defense & network forensics**
- **AI-assisted reconnaissance (ARRIA)**
- **Red-team methodologies & adversarial thinking**
- **Enterprise-level negotiation & B2B sales strategy**
- **Technical evangelism for cybersecurity & cloud products**

My goal is simple:

> Turn complex technologies into systems that are secure, understandable, and easy for organizations to adopt.

## 🚀 Azcendria Astral

**Global Workforce Accelerator · Digital Skills Engine · Talent Intelligence Platform**  
**Tagline:** *Where Skills Speak Louder than Resumes*

Azcendria Astral builds a secure, AI-augmented talent ecosystem that accelerates engineers, analysts, and technical professionals into global-standard careers.

We unify training, intelligence frameworks, employer pipelines, and real-world execution into one integrated system.

### Chemo Safe Language (Official Positioning)

Azcendria Astral develops proprietary automation frameworks, intelligence workflows, and educational architectures.  
Our internal AI tools (including “Kimo De Cinco”) are **branding and workflow concepts only** — built on top of licensed, third-party AI platforms.  

- We do **not** imply ownership of, partnership with, or endorsement by any AI vendor (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).  
- All prompts, playbooks, and methods are independently created internal assets of **Azcendria Astral**.  
- Students, employers, and partners always remain in control of their own data, tools, and accounts.

## 💼 Sales Systems Engineering

I treat sales like an engineering discipline.

My playbooks & systems cover:

- SDR & BDR **pipeline acceleration**
- **Full assumptive closing** with value-driven consultative sales
- Technical sales for **cybersecurity SaaS** and infrastructure
- Enterprise account strategy for **U.S. B2B + BPO + enterprise** clients
- Multi-channel activation (email, CRM, social, voice)

Blending security understanding with sales psychology is my competitive edge.
